Starting with the three datasets provided by the client, my approach integrated Random Forest Regression to develop a predictive model for estimating stock values. Through data transformation and feature engineering processes, we merged the datasets, creating a comprehensive dataset that encapsulates crucial factors influencing stock performance. This method ensured that the model could effectively capture the intricate relationships between various features and stock values. By leveraging Random Forest Regression, known for its robustness in handling complex datasets, we aimed to deliver accurate predictions that align with the dynamic nature of the stock market.
